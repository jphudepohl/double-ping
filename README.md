# double-ping

This is an NDN application designed to investigate the difference in travel times for interest packets in relation to data packets. The files should be put in the ndn-cxx/examples directory and can be built using the instructions found at: https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx/tree/master/examples.

This code has been adapted based on the ndn-cxx consumer and producer applications (https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx/tree/master/examples), as well as the ndn-tools implementation of ndnping (https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/tree/master/tools/ping).
